## Problem statement

Atliq Grands, a prominent owner of multiple five-star hotels across India with a rich 20-year history in the hospitality industry, is facing challenges in market share and revenue due to competitive strategies and management decisions. To address this, the managing director has proposed integrating "Business and Data Intelligence" to enhance their market position.

However, lacking an internal data analytics team, Atliq Grands' revenue management department has opted to engage a third-party service provider to extract insights from their historical data.
